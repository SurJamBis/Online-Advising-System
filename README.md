Not only because it makes thing easier, but also because it saves our time. In today's time,
people are extremely occupied with their work, and wanting to reduce the burden of their
daily activities. These web applications are pervasively use in education sector, and one of
the popular applications is online advising system. Meeting with counselor is one of the
major requirements that students must fullled. In the past, appointment process used to
be done manually, where students had to stand in the line and wait for the turn. Sometimes,
people crowded in line, and sometimes people will not show up for appointment. To solve
such kind of problems, online advising application system developed. Not only to eliminate
human error, but also to make the appointment scheduling feasible for everyone This is an
example of a citation.
The main purpose of this project is to develop an online advising scheduling system for
the students, and the advisors. This application enables students to safely login to the system
to schedule an appointment online, where all the detail information will be listed. Student's
will be able to see all the major advisors, and academic advisors with their available date
and time. They can cancel, reschedule their appointment as per their convenience. This
system surely saves student's time when they will not have to stayed in hold for like thirty
minutes to reschedule their appointment.
